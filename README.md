This repository contains the data and programs associated with the 10th task of SemEval 2024. The task is to classify Hinglish dialogues based on emotions, into eight different classes. 

The preprocessing files contain code for text normalization, Levenshtein distance calculation, removal of names and stopwords.

There are seven notebooks, each of which with a different type of model.

We observe that HingRoberta performs the best with a weighted-F1 score of 0.45.
