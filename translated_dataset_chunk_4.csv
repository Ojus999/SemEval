All I really needed was a plan.,neutral
See I wanna have three kids,neutral

"I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.",neutral
"Oh yes, well theres the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!",non-neutral
"Yes, thats very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.",neutral
"Yes, I realize that",neutral
"And Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.",neutral
I love working with designers!,joy
"With them, under them, whats the difference? Eh, Rach?",neutral
"Chandler, you have an assistant right?",neutral
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!,fear
"Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.",neutral

"Now, I know what youre thinking, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and youre right, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls.",non-neutral
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.,surprise

"First of all um, I love you both so much and youre both so important to me",non-neutral
"Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!",non-neutral

"Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine",neutral
Yes!!! Oh!!,joy
Hypothetically!,non-neutral
Still.,neutral
If Phoebe were my maid of honor,neutral
Uh-hmm.,neutral
"Rachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachels, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.",neutral

"Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye!",non-neutral
"Oh god, my eye!""",non-neutral
"I mean, it is so annoying.",non-neutral
"Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.",neutral
"Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?",surprise
Maybe on some level.,neutral
Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?,surprise
"No, Im picking you up for our date. These are for you.",neutral
"Ohh, Lilies. Joey, theyre my favorite. Thank you.",joy
