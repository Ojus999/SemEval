And then whoever does gets the phone.,neutral
"Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.",neutral
I dont think so.,non-neutral
"Fine all right, but Id bet youd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.",anger
"All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.",neutral
"Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.",sadness

Oh yeah!,joy
"Well okay, so then youre fine.",neutral
The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.,neutral
So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.,neutral
"Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble.",neutral
"Look, you guys have been to every play Ive ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?",neutral

Theyre wildly unpopular.,neutral
Oh my God!,disgust

Why?  Seriously I did not understand a word that    you said.,surprise
In the hall.,neutral
"Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping.",neutral
But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.,neutral
"Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.",neutral
"Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.",neutral
That's a good one!,joy
"Hey, Joe.",neutral

Ms. Monroe  Oh there you go.,neutral
Mark's a genius!,surprise
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?,surprise
"Look, don't you see what's happening here.",non-neutral
"Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.",non-neutral
Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.,neutral
"Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that.",neutral
"All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.",neutral
I don't know you guys.,fear
"All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you.",disgust
"And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'",disgust
"And before you know it, she's with him.",non-neutral
"And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'",non-neutral
"And he'll be all, 'Yes!'",non-neutral
"And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'",non-neutral
"And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.'",disgust
"And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'",disgust

"Hey, yknow what, if youre gonna do that, if youre gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.",neutral
"Chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you get to know him.",neutral
"Oh well, hey, Joeys loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, hell be there.",neutral
"Well, Chandler will be there for you too.",neutral
"I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, hell be there.",neutral
"And hell bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youre really hot.",neutral
What do ya say? What do ya say?,neutral
